## Correlation Plot
![Alt text](wo_vs_beer.png)

The number of WO students rose consistently from 2006 to 2018. The Bear consumption stayed almost flat and started to increase in 2013. Both trend upwards but the relative growth of the WO students is much larger than that of the beer consumption. There seems to be a correlation but this is likely due to them having the same trend rather than a causal relationship.
